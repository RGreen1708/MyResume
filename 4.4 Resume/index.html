    <p>
      I am the owner/director of Ryan Engineering LTD, a manufacturing
      engineering company with a contract at a tier 3 global manufacturing
      company - Johnson & Johnson MEDTECH. My role was to conduct a engineering
      trasnfer from Obidorf in Switzerland to Blackpool UK. During this trasfer
      i found scope for a large process improvement, which eventually enabled me
      to conduct a full engineering study into the bio-degradable,
      bio-absorbable material that was being manufactured at the blackpool site,
      used 3D modelling and mathematical formulas to take the current process
      and make it up to 5.5x as fast - increasing profit and quality.
